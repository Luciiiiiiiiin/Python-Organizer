# Python-Organizer


This is a program designed to organize files in a folder according to its file type, such as pdf, docx and so on. The motivation of this project is my messy download folder in my laptop which has a lot of different types of file. It is very helpful for users to organize file and delete the useless ones to free the storage space in their laptop.
